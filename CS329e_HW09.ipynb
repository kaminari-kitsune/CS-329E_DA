The partitions you already created in 2.2 will be the outer loop.

Use the Gini Index as your impurity measure. \n",

Use the array `np.array([0.1,0.25,0.3,0.4])` as the candidates for the best hyperparameter. If there is a tie (two `min_impurity_decrease` values give the same highest accuracy), choose the lowest `min_impurity_decrease` value. \n",
